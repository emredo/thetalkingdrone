    Base class for autopilot agents using LLM technology.

    This class provides a foundation for building LLM-powered autopilot systems

    Concrete implementations like GeminiAutopilotAgent use specific LLMs (such as
    Gemini 2.5 Pro) to interpret user commands and translate them into drone actions.
